# Vision
- A collection of simple minigames that are fun to make and fun to play
- Players should be able to learn and beat minigames in roughly 10 seconds
- Make sure the player can see the result of the minigame. Before calling a `MinigameCompletionHandler` callback, clearly show that the minigame has been won or lost.

# Adding a minigame
1. Install Unity 2019.4.12f1 LTS.
2. Fork the repo and clone your fork. You may need ssh auth setup for this to work.
3. Open project.
4. Set the `Game` resolution to 800x800.
5. Open the `SceneCoordinator` scene and hit play. This will give you an idea of everything fits together.
6. Create a new folder in Minigames.
7. Put your scene and all related files in your new folder.
8. Add your new scene to Build Settings.
9. Use a minigame-specific namespace for all of your scripts.
10. Make the minigame!
11. Check out another minigame scene and see how `Minigame Completion Handler` is used. You'll need to invoke the win and lose callbacks in the same way in your new minigame.
12. Open SceneCoordinator.cs and search for the comments `// Add new minigame here`
13. Make a pull request with your new minigame from your fork back to the original repo and tag `Aidan Waite` as a reviewer.
